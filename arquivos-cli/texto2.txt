When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
When all the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree, there will be an answer
Let it be
Although they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be, yeah
Let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Oh, let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be, yeah
Let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
There will be no sorrow
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
There will be no sorrow
Let it be
Let it be
Let it be
Yeah, Let it be
Yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
Yes
How was that?
That was alright sound to me, it sounded wonderful, was good- (clear)
The last two, the last one?
The last one was a whole better for me
That was it, I think it was for me too
I didn't get quite the words I had written here though
That's alright
